      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why Stansted Airport Charges a Drop-Off Fee</h2>
      <p>London Stansted Airport is one of the UK’s busiest hubs, serving millions of passengers each year. Whether you’re dropping off friends, family, or clients, understanding the airport’s current drop-off charges and rules can save time, money, and frustration. Stansted introduced its Express Set Down fee to keep traffic moving and fund site improvements. The charge discourages vehicles from lingering at the terminal, reducing congestion and emissions. By keeping the flow efficient, passengers benefit from quicker access to departures, while drivers avoid gridlock.</p>

    <section id="zones">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Express Set Down Zone – Closest to the Terminal</h2>
      <p>The Express Set Down zone is the most convenient place to drop passengers directly outside the terminal.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
        <li><strong>Price 2025:</strong> £7 for up to 15 minutes</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Beyond 15 Minutes:</strong> £25 flat charge</li>
        <li><strong>Return Within 30 Minutes:</strong> £20 re-entry fee</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-2">Drivers enter via the main terminal road, follow clear signs to “Express Set Down,” and pay at the exit barrier with card or contactless. There is no cash option. Tips: Aim to unload swiftly—have bags ready and say quick goodbyes. Avoid idling or waiting for passengers to exit security.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Free Drop-Off Option – Mid-Stay Car Park</h2>
      <p>If you prefer to avoid fees, the Mid-Stay Car Park is the best alternative. It offers 60 minutes of free parking, with a shuttle bus running every 10 minutes to the terminal (journey time around 7 minutes). After the first hour, normal mid-stay parking rates apply. Ideal for families or those assisting passengers with heavy luggage. Tip: Plan an extra 15–20 minutes to accommodate shuttle timing.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Short-Stay Car Parks for Longer Goodbyes</h2>
      <p>For those wanting to accompany passengers inside or wait for a confirmed flight, the Short-Stay Car Parks (Orange, Blue, Green zones) offer the convenience of being within walking distance of the terminal. Charges start around £7–£10 for 30 minutes (rates vary by zone). Perfect for meeting arriving travellers or if you need more time than Express Set Down allows.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Disabled Access & Blue Badge Holders</h2>
      <p>Stansted provides designated disabled bays within the Express Set Down area and Short-Stay Car Parks. Blue Badge holders still pay the standard tariff but can use wider bays and benefit from easier terminal access. If you need assistance, you can pre-book support through the airport’s special assistance service.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Key Rules and Restrictions</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
        <li>No waiting or idling: You must actively unload and leave.</li>
        <li>Camera enforcement: Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) tracks time precisely.</li>
        <li>No walking from Mid-Stay: Passengers must use the shuttle service for safety.</li>

    <section id="tips">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Planning Tips to Save Time and Money</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
        <li>Pre-plan drop-off: Know whether you’ll use Express, Mid-Stay, or Short-Stay before you arrive.</li>
        <li>Check traffic: The M11 and A120 can be busy during peak hours; allow extra time.</li>
        <li>Use ride-sharing apps or licensed minicabs: Pre-booked taxis can reduce the need for multiple family cars.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Comparing Stansted to Other London Airports</h2>
      <p>Stansted’s £7 fee is similar to Gatwick’s and slightly less than Heathrow’s terminal drop-off charge. All London airports now use drop-off fees to manage congestion, so the concept is standard across the region.</p>
